# User Controller

```Typescript
export type UserCreationParams = Pick<User, "email" | "name" | "phoneNumbers">;
```
Means ```UserCreationParams``` is a type, it takes out ```email```, ```name``` and ```phoneNumbers``` from **User** as props and ignore ```id``` and ```status```.

```Pick<T, K>``` is a way to pick from type T to form a new type.

### User Service
```UserService``` is a class exported to provide user-related actions.

#### Get Method
```Typescript
public get(id: number, name?: string): User {
return {
    id,
    email: "jane@doe.com",
    name: name ?? "Jane Doe",
    status: "Happy",
    phoneNumbers: [],
};
}
```
1. ```get(id, name?)``` is a way to mimic getting user from a database
2. takes in 2 parameters: ```id: number``` (must have), ```name?: string``` (optional)
3. if name is not provided, "Jane Doe" is used as default
4. the method returns a fixed **User** object which
   1. ```email``` is fixed
   2. ```status``` is "Happy"
   3. ```phoneNumbers``` is an empty array
